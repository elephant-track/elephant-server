    Apply gaussian smoothing on a

        channels (int, sequence):
            Number of channels of the input tensors.
            Output will have this number of channels as well.

            Size of the gaussian kernel.
        sigma (float, sequence):
            Standard deviation of the gaussian kernel.
        dim (int, optional):
            The number of dimensions of the data.
